## #Booking System - in development

## _Description_

_Booking System_ is an **Express js REST API** project for creating and booking hotels. And everything (hopefully) will be tested.

### _Stack used_

```
1. Node
2. Express
3. Mongodb, mongoose
4. Jest
```

#### _What will I learn_

My point is to thoroughly learn Rest API, JWT token authentication, stack used,
as well as tests, good practices in documanting my code and using Git for a bigger project.
